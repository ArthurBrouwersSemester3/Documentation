## Retrospective 
Negative
- Motivation:

  Our concentration and motivation has been slacking after working on one subject with little to no progress.

- Underestimating

  We underestimated how much time it would cost to get comfortable with Java and a new IDE that came with it. 
  We also underestimated the time it would take us to make it so CI would not push when it failed. 

- Time management

  We have worked for too long on one subject and did not make any progress. 
  We should realize earlier when to move on to a different subject.
  
Positve
- Documentation

This sprint, we created our group documentation. Before, we saved everything in a google docs document, but it is a better practice to save it in our github. 

- Communication

Both of us has kept our promises and was a reliable partner this sprint. We had frequent talks about the progress and what we were doing. 

- Collaberating

Last sprint, we had some issues regarding this topic. We worked on the exact same functionality and that slowed down the progress. This sprint, we decided to work on different functionalities and only work together if the other is in need of help.

We decided to use the Clash Royale method again, since it worked very well last time.
