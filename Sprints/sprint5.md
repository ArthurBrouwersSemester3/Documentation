## Retrospective 
Negative
- Continuous workdays

If possible, it is better to work consecutively. This way we keep track and have a better overview of where we are at.

- Keep priorities

In the sprint planning we took priority into account, but we could have kept the priorities in mind while working better.

Positve
- Switch gears quickly

If something goes a different route than planned, we did not have any problems adjusting. For example, we wanted to use Eclipse IDE, but when we couldn't figure it out, we realized IntelliJ was the better choice. It was the better choice for us because fellow students used it and it felt more familiar like visual studio.

- Update planning

While working on the project, some new task arise. This sprint we did a good job on documenting this by updating the sprint planning. We knew if our sprint planning needed to be updated, because we did a stand up each morning and looked at the sprint planning. 

- Splitting work

Instead of one person coding and the other one just looking, this sprint we made sure we both had our tasks. This way, we did not work together that much on the same specific tasks, which caused some delay in the past.

For this retrospective, we used the Clash Royale method once again, since it worked very well previous times.
