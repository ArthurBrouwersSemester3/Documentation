## Retrospective 
Negative
- Losing track

If we work together on one task, one of us writes the code and the other one is helping and thinking along. When you do not write the code yourself, it is easy to lose track. If this happens, we need to alarm eachother and ask for explanation.
  
Positve
- Switch gears quickly

If something goes a different route than planned, we did not have any problems adjusting. For example, we wanted to use Eclipse IDE, but when we couldn't figure it out, we realized IntelliJ was the better choice. It was the better choice for us because fellow students used it and it felt more familiar like visual studio.

- Different outcome than expected

We invisioned CI to work a bit different than what we achieved. It still meets the requirements, so we accepted that our imagined functionilaty is not a priority.

For this retrospective, we used the Clash Royale method once again, since it worked very good previous times.
