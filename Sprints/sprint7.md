## Retrospective 
Negative
- Planning

This sprint, we had two less days than expected. We could have anticipated on this while creating the sprintplanning

- ChatGPT

We need to realize faster that ChatGPT has data untill 2021, so it can be easily outdated in some cases. This has taken more time than it should have. 

Positve
- Perseverance

When things went wrong, we continued working on it. Sometimes by doing a spike.

- Spike

If we didn't manage to figure out how something worked, we did it by doing a spike. We played around half a day with the technology outside of our project to get familiar with it.
