# Front end
We needed to do research on front end languages. The requirement from school was that it should be a javascript framework.
We made the decision to choose one of the following frameworks:
- Angular
- React
- Vue

Both of us wrote down what we considered important in the framework, which were (sorted by importance):
1. Easy to learn.
2. Detailed documentation.
3. Widely used.

We found the pros and cons of each framework:

- Angular:

Pros:
Flexibility — Angular is a cross-platform framework, so you are not limited by your browser; you can also compile and execute applications at the server side or across different environments with the help of third-party libraries, e.g. NativeScript.
Third-party integrations — Angular can be integrated with a range of tools, extending development opportunities for software engineers.
High performance — the framework ensures faster load time and better security due to the ahead-of-time compiler, which converts HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the development.
Real-time synchronization — the default two-way data binding feature ensures real-time synchronization of changes between the view and the model, which reduces the room for error.
Customization — you can customize components and reuse them in other Angular projects or even projects created with another framework.
Google support — the development framework is fully maintained by Google, which cannot but be an advantage.
Large community — you can always rely on the vast Angular community if you need help.

Cons:
Hard to learn — developers agree that the Angular framework is more complicated compared to React or Vue, and the documentation may be confusing.
Heavy — due to its complexity, Angular is heavier than React, which can negatively impact dynamic apps, and code optimization will be required.

- React:

Pros:
Easy to learn — this is a very simple framework, especially for those who are familiar with frontend and JavaScript. In addition, there are many comprehensive tutorials available.
Usability — the framework is cross-platform, the code is easy-to-read, and the threshold is low, which means you can quickly jump to real projects.
Fast development — reusable components speed up the development process and make it more convenient.
Version control — old code runs smoothly in each new version, and React will prompt users to update obsolete elements if any.
Facebook support — let’s be honest, it’s important for a framework to be supported by a company as powerful as Facebook. This adds confidence that the solution will be stable in the foreseeable future.
Large community — developers from all over the world use React, so the community has accumulated an extensive knowledge base: tons of articles, tutorials, open-source ready-made /solutions and active development experts will help you solve any issue.

Cons:
Poor documentation — due to the rapid development and frequent updates in React technologies, it’s hard to prepare thorough documentation.
JSX complexity — it often takes time to gain insight into the JSX feature.

- Vue:

Pros:
Easy to learn — the framework syntax is comprehensible even to beginners; prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS is sufficient.
High performance — due to its simplicity and small size, Vue is an incredibly fast and scalable tool.
Third-party integrations — Vue can easily integrate with other libraries and existing projects.
Virtual DOM — an abstraction of the traditional DOM is a default feature, and it can help you significantly optimize the app performance.
Detailed documentation — considerable work was done on documentation in Vue 3.0 version.

Cons:
Small community — since the development framework is relatively young, its community still needs to grow to the size of competitors like Angular and React. Moreover, digital market giants still don’t widely use this framework.
Linguistic challenges — many Vue components are written in Chinese, which can be an obstacle for developers from other regions.


Conclusion
Taking these points into account, we think easy to learn is the most important. That means that we will not use Angular since it's hard to learn compared to Vue and React. 
We consider detailed documentation more important than a large community, because we can simply find more detailed information to learn the framework. 
Therefore we have made the decision to use Vue.
