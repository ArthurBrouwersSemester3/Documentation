# Front-end
We needed to do research on front end languages. The requirement from school was that it should be a javascript framework.
We made the decision to choose one of the following frameworks:
- Angular
- React
- Vue

Both of us wrote down what we considered important in the framework, which were (sorted by importance):
1. Easy to learn.
2. Detailed documentation.
3. Widely used.

We found the pros and cons of each framework:

## Angular:

Pros:
- Flexibility 

Angular is a cross-platform framework, so you are not limited by your browser; you can also compile and execute applications at the server side or across different environments with the help of third-party libraries, e.g. NativeScript.

- Third-party integrations 

Angular can be integrated with a range of tools, extending development opportunities for software engineers.

- High performance 

the framework ensures faster load time and better security due to the ahead-of-time compiler, which converts HTML and TypeScript code into efficient JavaScript code during the development.

- Real-time synchronization 

the default two-way data binding feature ensures real-time synchronization of changes between the view and the model, which reduces the room for error.

- Customization 

you can customize components and reuse them in other Angular projects or even projects created with another framework.

- Google support

the development framework is fully maintained by Google, which cannot but be an advantage.

- Large community 

you can always rely on the vast Angular community if you need help.

Cons:
- Hard to learn 

developers agree that the Angular framework is more complicated compared to React or Vue, and the documentation may be confusing.

- Heavy 

due to its complexity, Angular is heavier than React, which can negatively impact dynamic apps, and code optimization will be required.

## React:

Pros:
- Easy to learn 

this is a very simple framework, especially for those who are familiar with frontend and JavaScript. In addition, there are many comprehensive tutorials available.

- Usability 

the framework is cross-platform, the code is easy-to-read, and the threshold is low, which means you can quickly jump to real projects.

- Fast development 

reusable components speed up the development process and make it more convenient.

- Version control 

old code runs smoothly in each new version, and React will prompt users to update obsolete elements if any.

- Facebook support 

let’s be honest, it’s important for a framework to be supported by a company as powerful as Facebook. This adds confidence that the solution will be stable in the foreseeable future.

- Large community 
developers from all over the world use React, so the community has accumulated an extensive knowledge base: tons of articles, tutorials, open-source ready-made /solutions and active development experts will help you solve any issue.

Cons:
- Poor documentation 

due to the rapid development and frequent updates in React technologies, it’s hard to prepare thorough documentation.

- JSX complexity 

it often takes time to gain insight into the JSX feature.

## Vue:

Pros:
- Easy to learn 

the framework syntax is comprehensible even to beginners; prior knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS is sufficient.

- High performance 

due to its simplicity and small size, Vue is an incredibly fast and scalable tool.

- Third-party integrations 

Vue can easily integrate with other libraries and existing projects.

- Virtual DOM 

an abstraction of the traditional DOM is a default feature, and it can help you significantly optimize the app performance.

- Detailed documentation 

considerable work was done on documentation in Vue 3.0 version.

Cons:
- Small community 

since the development framework is relatively young, its community still needs to grow to the size of competitors like Angular and React. Moreover, digital market giants still don’t widely use this framework.

- Linguistic challenges 

many Vue components are written in Chinese, which can be an obstacle for developers from other regions.


## Conclusion
Taking these points into account, we think easy to learn is the most important. That means that we will not use Angular since it's hard to learn compared to Vue and React. 
We consider detailed documentation more important than a large community, because we can simply find more detailed information to learn the framework. 
Therefore we have made the decision to use Vue.

# Back-end
We needed to choose a back-end language that used the OO principles. We asked ChatGPT for the most used OO based languages and their pros and cons. 
These were the results:

## Java:

Pros:
- Platform-independent

Java programs can run on any device that has the JVM installed, regardless of the operating system.

- Strong support for concurrency

Java's built-in threading features make it easy to write multithreaded programs.

- Large community and ecosystem

Java has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, making it easy to find solutions to common programming problems.

Cons:
- Relatively verbose syntax

Java code can be more verbose than other programming languages, which can lead to longer development times.

- Garbage collection

Java's automatic garbage collection can sometimes lead to performance issues in large-scale applications.

- Can be complex

Java can be complex to learn, especially for beginners.

## Python:

Pros:
- Easy to learn and use
- Large community and extensive libraries
- Versatile and widely used for scientific computing, web development, and AI/ML
- Cross-platform support

Cons:
- Slower compared to lower-level languages like C++
- Not ideal for high-performance applications or real-time systems
- Limited support for parallel processing

## C++:

Pros:
- High performance and efficient memory usage
- Low-level control over system resources
- Widely used for developing operating systems, game engines, and other performance-critical applications
- Large community and extensive libraries

Cons:
- Steep learning curve
- Prone to memory leaks and segmentation faults
- Not suitable for rapid prototyping or scripting

## C#:

Pros:
- Modern, object-oriented programming language
- Easy to learn and use
- Designed specifically for the .NET platform, with extensive libraries and tools
- Widely used for developing Windows desktop applications, web applications, and games

Cons:
- Limited cross-platform support
- Requires installation of the .NET runtime environment
- Proprietary language, with limited open-source development

## conclusion
For the back-end, we value almost the same things as the front-end. These things are:
- Large community
- Speed

Because Python is relatively slow and not ideal for real-time systems, we did not take Python in consideration.
We also dropped C++, because it is not suitable for rapid prototyping, so it contradicts our value "Speed". 

Fontys also adviced to use .NET or Java. So our conclusion matches this. 
We considered Java and C# the most, because they're used most in the real world.
Since we both have experience with C#, we would like the challenge to learn Java.
