We decided to try a new Retrospective which we made ourselves: the Clash royale retrospective.
On the left side you can see the positive things in green and on the right side you see the negative things in red. The opponent (upper half) and us (lower half) both have towers. The closer the text is to a tower, the bigger the issue or the better the succes is.

    - You click search and it redirects you to a page with a graph that shows how busy it is per day and per hour in basic fit Eindhoven.
 - CI not pushing code when CI fails
 - Research Back-end
 - Research API
 - Create project documentation
 - Refine acceptance criteria and user stories

## Retrospective
Negative
- Motivation:

  Our concentration and motivation has been slacking after working on one subject with little to no progress.

- Underestimating

  We underestimated how much time it would cost to get comfortable with Java and a new IDE that came with it. 
  We also underestimated the time it would take us to make it so CI would not push when it failed. 

- Time management

  We have worked for too long on one subject and did not make any progress. 
  We should realize earlier when to move on to a different subject.
