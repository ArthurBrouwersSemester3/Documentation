### Retrospective
Negative
- collaborating on same tasks:
  Working on the exact same functionality.
- planning: 
  Keep the planning up to date and structured.

  instead of only using word/docs document it
  in your portfolio.

Positive

We decided to try a new Retrospective which we made ourselves: the Clash Royale retrospective.
On the left side you can see the positive things in green and on the right side you see the negative things in red. The opponent (upper half) and us (lower half) both have towers. The closer the text is to a tower, the bigger the issue or the better the succes is.

We achieved nearly all the goals we set for this sprint. We didn't end up fully completing user story 1
we are happy how this sprint went, We made a great start with our frond-end and are happy with how it is looking at this moment.

## Sprint 3 (17/03/2023 - 31/03/2023)
### Goals
 - US1: There must be a page with a graph that shows the average crowd per day, per hour in the selected gym
    - You click search and it redirects you to a page with a graph that shows how busy it is per day and per hour in basic fit Eindhoven.
 - CI not pushing code when CI fails
 - Research Back-end
 - Research API
 - Create project documentation
 - Refine acceptance criteria and user stories

## Retrospective 
Negative
- Motivation:

  Our concentration and motivation has been slacking after working on one subject with little to no progress.

- Underestimating

  We underestimated how much time it would cost to get comfortable with Java and a new IDE that came with it. 
  We also underestimated the time it would take us to make it so CI would not push when it failed. 

- Time management

  We have worked for too long on one subject and did not make any progress. 
  We should realize earlier when to move on to a different subject.
  
Positve
- Documentation

This sprint, we created our group documentation. Before, we saved everything in a google docs document, but it is a better practice to save it in our github. 

- Communication

Both of us has kept our promises and was a reliable partner this sprint. We had frequent talks about the progress and what we were doing. 

- Collaberating

Last sprint, we had some issues regarding this topic. We worked on the exact same functionality and that slowed down the progress. This sprint, we decided to work on different functionalities and only work together if the other is in need of help.

We decided to use the Clash Royale method again, since it worked very well last time.


## Sprint 4 (31/03/2023 - 14/04/2023)
### Goals
 - Research Java/IDE
 - CI: not pushing when it fails
 - Update portfolio
 - Set up API
 - Clean up code
 - US1: There must be a page with a graph that shows the average crowd per day, per hour in the selected gym (API)
 - US 1: You click on a dropdown and select Basic fit Eindhoven (API)

## Retrospective 
Negative
- Losing track

If we work together on one task, one of us writes the code and the other one is helping and thinking along. When you do not write the code yourself, it is easy to lose track. If this happens, we need to alarm eachother and ask for explanation.
  
Positve
- Switch gears quickly

If something goes a different route than planned, we did not have any problems adjusting. For example, we wanted to use Eclipse IDE, but when we couldn't figure it out, we realized IntelliJ was the better choice. It was the better choice for us because fellow students used it and it felt more familiar like visual studio.

- Different outcome than expected

We invisioned CI to work a bit different than what we achieved. It still meets the requirements, so we accepted that our imagined functionilaty is not a priority.

For this retrospective, we used the Clash Royale method once again, since it worked very previous times.
