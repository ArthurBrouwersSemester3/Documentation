# Back-end
We needed to choose a back-end language that used the OO principles. We asked ChatGPT for the most used OO based languages and their pros and cons. 
These were the results:

## Java:

Pros:
- Platform-independent

Java programs can run on any device that has the JVM installed, regardless of the operating system.

- Strong support for concurrency

Java's built-in threading features make it easy to write multithreaded programs.

- Large community and ecosystem

Java has a vast collection of libraries and frameworks, making it easy to find solutions to common programming problems.

Cons:
- Relatively verbose syntax

Java code can be more verbose than other programming languages, which can lead to longer development times.

- Garbage collection

Java's automatic garbage collection can sometimes lead to performance issues in large-scale applications.

- Can be complex

Java can be complex to learn, especially for beginners.

## Python:

Pros:
- Easy to learn and use
- Large community and extensive libraries
- Versatile and widely used for scientific computing, web development, and AI/ML
- Cross-platform support

Cons:
- Slower compared to lower-level languages like C++
- Not ideal for high-performance applications or real-time systems
- Limited support for parallel processing

## C++:

Pros:
- High performance and efficient memory usage
- Low-level control over system resources
- Widely used for developing operating systems, game engines, and other performance-critical applications
- Large community and extensive libraries

Cons:
- Steep learning curve
- Prone to memory leaks and segmentation faults
- Not suitable for rapid prototyping or scripting

## C#:

Pros:
- Modern, object-oriented programming language
- Easy to learn and use
- Designed specifically for the .NET platform, with extensive libraries and tools
- Widely used for developing Windows desktop applications, web applications, and games

Cons:
- Limited cross-platform support
- Requires installation of the .NET runtime environment
- Proprietary language, with limited open-source development

## conclusion
For the back-end, we value almost the same things as the front-end. These things are:
- Large community
- Speed

Because Python is relatively slow and not ideal for real-time systems, we did not take Python in consideration.
We also dropped C++, because it is not suitable for rapid prototyping, so it contradicts our value "Speed". 

Fontys also adviced to use .NET or Java. So our conclusion matches this. 
We considered Java and C# the most, because they're used most in the real world.
Since we both have experience with C#, we would like the challenge to learn Java.
