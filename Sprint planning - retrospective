### Retrospective
Sprint 2 went pretty smooth, we achieved all the goals we've set for this sprint.
We had some struggles in the beginning of making the Url shortcuts for the dashboard, our inexperience with Python and MongoDB let to us having to refine our User Preferences API a few times.

## Sprint 3 (31-10-2022 - 18-11-2022)
### Goals
- Unit Testing on the User-Preferences API
- Integrate automatic unit testing in the CI/CD
- Add some security to the User-Preferences API
- Add Side-Bar to Front-End

### Problems/Questions
- How can we best add security to the User-Preferences API?
- How do we unit test the User-Preferences API without touching the database?
- What kind of other tests should we add to our project? Why and how?

### Retrospective
The beginning of this sprint went a bit rough as we didn't have the right priorities. We went straight to building the Integrations-API instead of fixing problems that already existed. We solved this problem by first looking back at the problems we had (authentication, code smells, better issue overview), after solving these problems, we still had some time to start working on the Integrations-API.

## Sprint 4 (21-11-2022 - 9-12-2022)
### Goals
- Continiue working on the Integrations-API
- Taking more time to complete the userstories, so that we don't create more issues for us in the future.
- Create documentation Integration-API

### Retrospective
We reached our goals for this sprint, we put a lot of effort into finishing [this userstory](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/.github/issues/3).
It was a big userstory, and we made integration tests and unit tests where applicable to test the acceptance criteria of the userstory.

## Sprint 5 (12-12-2022 - ?)
### Goals
- Complete research about deployment.
- Add new [userstory for bron fontys](https://github.com/IPS3-DB04-Teun-Mos-Lukas-Jansen/Integration-API/issues/28)
